Monitoring predetermined learning books
Description of the idea
The system contains a variety of existing books that can be learned at the rate/division determined by the user
The books and their structure will be preserved in the system
Future upgrade - it will be possible to add additional books (for this the initial saving form will be generic)
Another future upgrade - to add a wide variety of learning materials of all types who want to learn them at their own pace.
The difference between this upgrade and the previous ones is that the following materials are not known all over the world and it is not appropriate to present them to everyone but should be associated with a group leader who has known group members in advance
Example: learning a certain course/language from learning materials known in advance divided in a division known in advance, etc...
The system is suitable for this upgrade except for the need to add a group/group members and their leadership
The system can be used in private/group mode.
Private system - the user determines learning material, learning distribution, time layout, form of reminders, etc
upgrade
A group system will have a group manager who will determine all kinds of decisions: time, study pace, messages to the group, whether everyone can see the other's progress or just graphs without names.
